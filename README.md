# Data structures and algorithms

The idea behind this repository is to practice problems around Data structures and algorithms and get a hang of golang. 

This effectively means that the code might not be great but I am not sure if that is even the focus here.

The key ideas are -
- Practice DSA problems
- Learn Golang

Current solutions include -

**Recursion**
- Search an element in a collection
- Revese a collection
- Power (x raise to y)
- Factorial
- Palindrome
- Permuatations of a string

**Stack**
- MatchParentheses
- Evaluate postfix
- Convert infix to postfix
