# Data structures and algorithms

The idea behind this repository is to practice problems around Data structures and algorithms and get a hang of golang. 

This effectively means that the code might not be great but I am not sure if that is even the focus here.

The key ideas are -
- Practice DSA problems
- Learn Golang

Current solutions cover the following areas -

- **Recursion**
- **Stack**
- **Binary Tree**
- **Binary Search Tree**

One of the other things that I wish to get out of this repository is figure out some real life use-cases of various data structures. 
Eg; AVL trees might be used in some databases for lookup operations. Figure that out and add it here.
