# Data structures and algorithms

The idea behind this repository is to practice problems around Data structures and algorithms and get a hang of Golang. 

This effectively means that the code might not be great but I hope to improve it gradually.

The key ideas are -
- Practice DSA problems
- Learn Golang

Current solutions cover different problems from the following areas -

- **Recursion**
- **Stack**
- **Queue**
- **Linked List**
- **Binary Tree**
- **Binary Search Tree**
- **Array**
- **Bit Manipulation**
- **Hashing**
  - Chaining
  - Linear probing
  - Quadratic probing
  - Double hashing

One of the other things that I wish to get out of this repository is figure out some real life use-cases of various data structures. 
A simple example, Java's Hashmap uses Red-Black tree, figure out such uses, their reasoning and add them here.
